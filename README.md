# Doze Studio Web Scroll Project

## Overview
This project is an innovative web scroll enhancement inspired by the Doze Studio website. Instead of using a traditional video, I transformed the video content into a dynamic image scroller that mimics video playback. This project showcases various modern web development techniques and effects.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic HTML** for structure and content.
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling.
- **1,345 JPEG images** extracted from a video to create the scroll effect.
- **Fading text** that appears and disappears as you scroll.
- **Canvas elements** with animated frames that update based on scroll position.
- **Jibberish text** with a fading opacity effect as you scroll down.
- **Lenis** for smooth scrolling animation.

## Technologies Used
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn): A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- [GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/gsap): A powerful JavaScript library for creating animations.
- [Lenis](https://github.com/darkroomengineering/lenis): A lightweight smooth scroll library for enhancing scrolling experiences.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdulRaffayQureshi/Doze-Web-Scroll.git


Note
Due to GitHub's limitations, I couldn't upload the images directly. To fully enjoy the project, you'll need to extract the images from the video yourself.
